    An entirely new concept of sports car. More efficient – for example due to intelligent lightweight construction with carbon and aerodynamic design. More sustainable – with highly efficient BMW eDrive technology and recyclable materials in the interior.
    Without forfeiting dynamics and its sporting appearance. No compromises, but instead the optimum combination of driving pleasure and responsibility. The BMW i8 is a plug-in-hybrid that brings together the advantages of innovate electric
    motor and combustion engine technologies. The result is an extraordinary driving experience – with extremely low consumption and low emissions.
